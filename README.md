# zengm_baseball_rosters
not sure who made the original, but team names/data taken from the file posted by officialjt3_ on the bbgm discord. Don't really know how to do any of this crap I just took 2020 OOTP ratings and modified them and tried to scale them in a manner similar to default zengm baseball ratings then made it into a JSON file. Fielding is pretty messed up but league averages aren't bad. Not enough doubles (or runs in general). I think I'll also make 2005 and maybe 2024 and see what happens. As you can see Greg Garcia is the only rookie and I don't think I have it in me to fix that, but feel free to do so yourself.
